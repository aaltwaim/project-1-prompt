This is tic tac toe is game let you choose if you want to play with a another player or the computer but the AI opponent is not working now.

If the user choose to play as two player mode it will let you play as X for player one and O for player two and the game info keeps track of the each player if the win or if the game is tie and store the info in local storage. The game also allow you to start a new game and reset all the result to 0. Also, this is one player modewhich is an random fanction that add O after the the player put x in one of the boxes.

the winnerCheck function works by calling theGame function and check if the winner satisfy 9 conditions to win and then alert the user if they win. After that it increment the win to the winner result in the game info and store the result in the local storage and it clear all the boxes.


I added some additional features such as 
1- playing music in the background, 
2- I used the local storage to keep tarck of the game results.
3- changing the between dark and white theme.
4- reset botton that 0 all the statistic and clear the local storage.



List of improvment to be made in the future
1- improve the one player mode to make it as an AI opponent.
2- need some CSS improvement in a responsive design.
